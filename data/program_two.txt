; PROGRAM 2
; A program that reads a set of a paragraph of 6 sentences from a file into
; memory. It prints the sentences on the console printer. It then asks the user for a word. It
; searches the paragraph to see if it contains the word. If so, it prints out the word, the
; sentence number, and the word number in the sentence.

; Step by step how program 2 is working:
; 1. Read 6 sentences from a file into memory using the IN instruction and DEVID = 2 (card reader) and CHK.
;       This will be done in the READ_STRING_FROM_DEVICE subroutine.
; 2. Print this message to the console using the PRINT_STRING subroutine.
; 3. Prompt the user for a word using the PRINT_STRING subroutine and a pre-made message.
; 4. Record the word entered using the READ_STRING subroutine.
; 5. Search the paragraph for the word entered. This will be done in the FIND_WORD subroutine.
;       Save the sentence number and word number in the sentence where the word is found.
; 6. Finally, print out the word, sentence number, and word number in the sentence if the word is found.
;       This can either be done in a subroutine or in the main program.

; A quick not about memory layout. I will try to reserve 0-1023 for data, constants, and variables.
; Program START begins at 1024 (octal 2000).
; Subroutines will be above all code in the START program.

; LOW MEMORY (6-31): lookup tables for subroutines etc. and some variables
;currently at 0 out of 32 words

        HIGHMEM_ADDR_1: Data HIGHMEM_1
        STRING_ARRAY_ADDR: Data STRING_ARRAY

        ;index register temp store - used to maintain index state after subroutine call
        ;Note: I try to keep a "focus" for each index register. However, in the subroutines,
        ;this will be mostly ignored since the main code index registers are stored and restored
        ;in the subroutine.
        TEMPX1:       Data 0 ;use this mostly for subroutines
        TEMPX2:       Data 0 ;use this mostly for ARRAY
        TEMPX3:       Data 0 ;use this mostly for HIGHNUM

        ;high memory locations. Don't assign these directly, maintain a list of comments noting
        ;  what each offset relates to. 32-127 is used for variables.
        LOC 32
        HIGHMEM_1:    Data 0

        ;jump table locations
        LOC 128 ; 128-255 is used for subroutine jump tables (J_TABLE_1, J_TABLE_2, J_TABLE_3, J_TABLE_4 32-words each)
J_TABLE_1:
        READ_STRING_FROM_DEVICE_ADDR:         Data READ_STRING_FROM_DEVICE           ;0

        LOC 256 ; 256-1023 is used for saving the string. That implies the max length of the string is 767 characters.
        STRING_ARRAY: Data 0 ;index 0 for the string. Print string by looping until you hit a null pointer.
